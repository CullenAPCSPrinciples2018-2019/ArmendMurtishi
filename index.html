      <h2>Programming</h2>
      <p>From a very young age I took interest in computers and how they work. As I grew older, my father, an electrical engineer, taught me some basics of programming as he built a server and created a website from scratch from our basement. At this point I was capable of researching on my own using the internet, and I began developing small projects. Over the years I have continued this, and listed here are a few of them:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/bigfatman17/flappy">https://github.com/bigfatman17/flappy</a> - <i>A clone of the popular game <b>Flappy Bird.</b></i></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/bigfatman17/maze3d">https://github.com/bigfatman17/maze3d</a> - <i>A 3D maze generator. My first experiment with 3D.</i></li>
      </ul>
      <p>In sophomore year, my computer-science teacher allowed us to publish our assignments on GitHub.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/ArmendMurtishi/android-quad-solver">https://github.com/ArmendMurtishi/android-quad-solver</a> - A quadratic solver for Android.</li>

        <li><a href="https://github.com/ArmendMurtishi/class_scheduler">https://github.com/ArmendMurtishi/class_scheduler</a> - Allows a principal/administrator to submit student requests for classes, and will attempt to generate a schoolwide schedule.</li>

      <h2>Music</h2>
      <p>Throughout my life I have shown an interest in music, but I was selfishly reluctant to take lessons, insisting that I could learn myself. In 6th grade, my parents forced me to sign up for piano lessons, and I forgive them entirely. Lessons improved my piano incredibly, and I have gone on to play classics from composers like Mozart and Chopin. Here are a few pieces I have played:</p>

        <tr>
          <td>Chopin</td>
          <td><i>Grande Valse brillante</i></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Clementi</td>
          <td>All of his Sonatinas</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Joplin</td>
          <td><i>The Entertainer</i></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Pachelbel</td>
          <td><i>Canon in D</i></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Mozart</td>
          <td><i>alla Turca</i></td>
        </tr>

      <h3>Investing/Security Analysis</h3>
      <p>I've also always wondered how money works (i.e., how much is in circulation? How do banks work? etc.), and in finding this information I took an interest in investment and began to wonder why everyone says they've lost money in the stock market, but people like Warren Buffett seem to earn and earn. I read a book by Benjamin Graham, <i>The Intelligent Investor,</i> and am currently reading another of his, <i>Security Analysis.</i></p>
