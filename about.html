          <h2>Programming</h2>
          <p>From a very young age I took interest in computers and how they work. As I grew older, my father, an electrical engineer, taught me some basics of programming as he built a server and created a website from scratch from our basement. At this point I was capable of researching on my own using the internet, and I began developing small projects. Over the years I have continued this, and listed here are a few of them:</p>

          </ul>
          <p>In sophomore year, my computer-science teacher allowed us to publish our assignments on GitHub.</p>

          <h2>Music</h2>
          <p>Throughout my life I have shown an interest in music, but I was selfishly reluctant to take lessons, insisting that I could learn myself. In 6th grade, my parents forced me to sign up for piano lessons, and I forgive them entirely. Lessons improved my piano incredibly, and I have gone on to play classics from composers like Mozart and Chopin. Here are a few pieces I have played:</p>

          <h2>Investing/Security Analysis</h2>
          <p>I've also always wondered how money works (i.e., how much is in circulation? How do banks work? etc.), and in finding this information I took an interest in investment and began to wonder why everyone says they've lost money in the stock market, but people like Warren Buffett seem to earn and earn. I read a book by Benjamin Graham, <i>The Intelligent Investor,</i> and am currently reading another of his, <i>Security Analysis.</i></p>
